	<h1>Born to be together</h1>

	<p>01 May 2019 - ronettes</p>
	<p>“Born to Be Together” was released in February 1965 by Philles Records. It only reached number 52 on the Billboard 100.</p>

<p>The moment I saw you my heart knew it was forever<br />
You touched me and I swear I knew then and there that I’d never<br />
No I never<br />
Want somebody else to hold me<br />
Let another’s arms enfold me<br />
Never never want nobody but you<br />
And then you kissed me<br />
And whispered tenderly<br />
Darling I love you, I love you, I love you<br />
And I knew we were born to be together<br />
We were born to be together<br />
Baby we were born to be together<br />
I never said a word but I know you heard me sighing<br />
You held me to your heart and I almost started crying, almost crying<br />
Baby I’m so glad you found me<br />
Put your loving arms around me<br />
Say you want me just the way I want you<br />
And then please kiss me and softly answer me<br />
Darling I love you, I love you, I love you<br />
I’ll know we were born to be together<br />
We were born to be togeter<br />
Baby we were born to be together<br />
Baby we were born to be together (fade out)</p>
