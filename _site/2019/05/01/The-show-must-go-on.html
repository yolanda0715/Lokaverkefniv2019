	<h1>The show must go on</h1>

	<p>01 May 2019 - queen</p>
	<p>“The Show Must Go On” is a song by the British rock band Queen, featured as the twelfth and final track on their 1991 album Innuendo. It is credited to Queen, but written mainly by Brian May.[2] The song chronicles the effort of Freddie Mercury continuing to perform despite approaching the end of his life, although his diagnosis with HIV/AIDS had not yet been made public in spite of ongoing media speculation claiming that he was seriously ill.</p>

<p>Empty spaces, what are we living for?<br />
Abandoned places, I guess we know the score<br />
On and on, does anybody know what we are looking for?<br />
Another hero, another mindless crime<br />
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime<br />
Hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore?<br />
The show must go on<br />
The show must go on<br />
Yeah<br />
Inside my heart is breaking<br />
My make-up may be flaking<br />
But my smile still stays on<br />
Whatever happens, I’ll leave it all to chance<br />
Another heartache, another failed romance<br />
On and on, does anybody know what we are living for?<br />
I guess I’m learning (I’m learning), I must be warmer now<br />
I’ll soon be turning (turning, turning, turning), ‘round the corner now<br />
Outside the dawn is breaking<br />
But inside in the dark I’m aching to be free<br />
The show must go on<br />
The show must go on (yeah yeah)<br />
Ooh, inside my heart is breaking<br />
My make-up may be flaking<br />
But my smile still stays on<br />
Yeah<br />
My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies<br />
Fairy tales of yesterday will grow but never die<br />
I can fly my friends<br />
The show must go on, yeah<br />
The show must go on<br />
I’ll face it with a grin<br />
I’m never giving in<br />
On with the show<br />
Ooh, I’ll top the bill, I’ll overkill<br />
I have to find the will to carry on<br />
(On with the show, on with the show)<br />
Show (show must go on, go on)</p>
