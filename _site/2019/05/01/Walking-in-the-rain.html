<p>I want him, and I need him,<br />
And someday someway woo I’ll meet him<br />
He’ll be kind of shy, and real good lookin’ too<br />
And I’ll be certain he’s my guy by the things he’ll like to do<br />
Like walking in the rain (like walking in the rain)<br />
And wishing on the stars (and wishing on the stars) up above<br />
And being so in love 
When he’s near me, I’ll kiss him,<br />
And when he leaves me woo I’ll miss him<br />
Though sometimes we’ll fight, I won’t really care<br />
And I’ll know it’s gonna be alright ‘cause we’ve got so much we share<br />
Like walking in the rain (like walking in the rain)<br />
And wishing on the stars (and wishing on the stars) up above<br />
And being so in love<br />
no no he’ll never do<br />
(Bobby) no it isn’t him too <br />
They would never no they’d never never ever ever love<br />
Walking in the rain (like walking in the rain)<br />
And wishing on the stars (and wishing on the stars) up above<br />
And being so in love<br />
Oh oh oh where can he be oh oh</p>
