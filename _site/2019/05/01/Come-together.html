<p>Here come old flat top<br />
He come groovin’ up slowly<br />
He got joo joo eyeballs<br />
He one holy roller<br />
He got hair down to his knee<br />
Got to be a joker<br />
He just do what he please<br />
He wear no shoeshine<br />
He got toe jam football<br />
He got monkey finger<br />
He shoot Coca-Cola<br />
He say I know you, you know me<br />
One thing I can tell you is<br />
You got to be free<br />
Come together, right now<br />
Over me<br />
He bad production<br />
He got walrus gumboot<br />
He got Ono sideboard<br />
He one spinal cracker<br />
He got feet down below his knee<br />
Hold you in his armchair<br />
You can feel his disease<br />
Come together, right now<br />
Over me<br />
He roller coaster<br />
He got early warning<br />
He got muddy water<br />
He one Mojo filter<br />
He say one and one and one is three<br />
Got to be good looking<br />
‘Cause he’s so hard to see<br />
Come together right now<br />
Over me<br />
Come together, yeah (x9)</p>
