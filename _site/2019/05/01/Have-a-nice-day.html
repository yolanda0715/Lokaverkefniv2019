	<h1>Have a nice day</h1>

	<p>01 May 2019 - bonjovi</p>
	<p>“Have a Nice Day” is a song by American rock band Bon Jovi. Written, composed and produced by Jon Bon Jovi, Richie Sambora, and John Shanks, “Have a Nice Day” was the first single released from the band’s 2005 album of the same name. The overall message of the song can be taken several ways, but reflects an overall theme of both tolerance and defiance, and its title has a discordant effect from its message.</p>

<p>Why, you wanna tell me how to live my life?<br />
Who, are you to tell me if it’s black or white?<br />
Mama, can you hear me? try to understand<br />
Is innocence the difference between a boy and a man<br />
My daddy lived the lie, it’s just the price that he paid<br />
Sacrificed his life, just slavin’ away<br />
Oh, if there’s one thing I hang onto<br />
That gets me through the night<br />
I ain’t gonna do what I don’t want to<br />
I’m gonna live my life<br />
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice<br />
Standing on the ledge, I show the wind how to fly<br />
When the world gets in my face<br />
I say, have a nice day<br />
Have a nice day<br />
Take a look around you; nothing’s what it seems<br />
We’re living in the broken home of hopes and dreams<br />
Let me be the first to shake a helping hand<br />
Anybody brave enough to take a stand<br />
I’ve knocked on every door, on every dead end street<br />
Looking for forgiveness<br />
What’s left to believe?<br />
Oh, if there’s one thing I hang onto<br />
That gets me through the night<br />
I ain’t gonna do what I don’t want to<br />
I’m gonna live my life<br />
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice<br />
Standing on the ledge, I show the wind how to fly<br />
When the world gets in my face<br />
I say, have a nice day<br />
Have a nice day<br />
Oh, if there’s one thing I hang onto<br />
That gets me through the night<br />
I ain’t gonna do what I don’t want to<br />
I’m gonna live my life<br />
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice<br />
Standing on the ledge, I show the wind how to fly<br />
When the world gets in my face<br />
I say, have a nice day<br />
Have a nice day<br />
Have a nice day<br />
Have a nice day<br />
Have a nice day<br />
When the world keeps trying, to drag me down<br />
I’ve gotta raise my hands, gonna stand my ground<br />
Well I say, have a nice day<br />
Have a nice day<br />
Have a nice day</p>
