	<p>01 May 2019 - queen</p>
	<p>“I Want to Break Free” is a song by the British rock band Queen, written by their bass guitarist John Deacon. It appears in the album The Works (1984), and was released in three versions: album, single and extended. It came to be included in most live concerts by the group, in several videos and in The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert where it was sung by Lisa Stansfield.</p>

<p>I want to break free<br />
I want to break free<br />
I want to break free from your lies<br />
You’re so self satisfied I don’t need you<br />
I’ve got to break free<br />
God knows, God knows I want to break free<br />
I’ve fallen in love<br />
I’ve fallen in love for the first time<br />
And this time I know it’s for real<br />
I’ve fallen in love, yeah<br />
God knows, God knows I’ve fallen in love<br />
It’s strange but it’s true, yeah<br />
I can’t get over the way you love me like you do<br />
But I have to be sure<br />
When I walk out that door<br />
Oh, how I want to be free, baby<br />
Oh, how I want to be free<br />
Oh, how I want to break free<br />
But life still goes on<br />
I can’t get used to living without, living without<br />
Living without you by my side<br />
I don’t want to live alone, hey<br />
God knows, got to make it on my own<br />
So baby can’t you see<br />
I’ve got to break free<br />
I’ve got to break free<br />
I want to break free, yeah<br />
I want, I want, I want, I want to break free</p>
