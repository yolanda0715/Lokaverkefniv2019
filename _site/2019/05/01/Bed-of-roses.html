	<h1>Bed of roses</h1>

	<p>01 May 2019 - bonjovi</p>
	<p>“Bed of Roses” is a song by American rock band Bon Jovi, first appearing in 1992 on the album Keep the Faith, then released as a single in late January 1993. Jon Bon Jovi wrote the song in a hotel room while suffering from a hangover and the lyrics reflect his feelings at the time. The song contains drawn out guitar riffs and soft piano playing, along with emotive and high vocals by Jon Bon Jovi.</p>

<p>Sitting here wasted and wounded<br />
At this old piano<br />
Trying hard to capture<br />
The moment this morning I don’t know<br />
‘Cause a bottle of vodka<br />
Is still lodged in my head<br />
And some blonde gave me nightmares<br />
I think that she’s still in my bed<br />
As I dream about movies<br />
They won’t make of me when I’m dead<br />
With an ironclad fist<br />
I wake up and french kiss the morning<br />
While some marching band keeps<br />
Its own beat in my head<br />
While we’re talking<br />
About all of the things that I long to believe<br />
About love and the truth and what you mean to me<br />
And the truth is, baby you’re all that I need<br />
I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses<br />
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails<br />
Oh, I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is<br />
And lay you down on a bed of roses<br />
Well I’m so far away<br />
That each step that I take is on my way home<br />
A king’s ransom in dimes I’d given each night<br />
Just to see through this payphone<br />
Still I run out of time<br />
Or it’s hard to get through<br />
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you<br />
I’ll just close my eyes and whisper<br />
Baby blind love is true<br />
I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses<br />
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails<br />
Oh, I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is<br />
And lay you down on a bed of roses<br />
Well, this hotel bar’s hangover whiskey’s gone dry<br />
The barkeeper’s wig’s crooked<br />
And she’s giving me the eye<br />
I might have said yeah<br />
But I laughed so hard I think I died, ooh yeah<br />
Now as you close your eyes<br />
Know I’ll be thinking about you<br />
While my mistress she calls me<br />
To stand in her spotlight again<br />
Tonight I won’t be alone<br />
But you know that don’t mean I’m not lonely<br />
I’ve got nothing to prove<br />
For it’s you that I’d die to defend<br />
I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses<br />
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails<br />
Oh, I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is<br />
And lay you down <br />
I wanna lay you down on a bed of roses<br />
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails<br />
I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is<br />
And lay you down<br />
On a bed of roses</p>
