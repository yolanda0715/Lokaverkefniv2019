	<h1>Bohemian rhapsody</h1>

	<p>01 May 2019 - queen</p>
	<p>“Bohemian Rhapsody” is a song by the British rock band Queen. It was written by Freddie Mercury for the band’s 1975 album A Night at the Opera. It is a six-minute suite, consisting of several sections without a chorus: an intro, a ballad segment, an operatic passage, a hard rock part and a reflective coda. The song is a more accessible take on the 1970s progressive rock genre.</p>

<p>Is this the real life?<br />
Is this just fantasy?<br />
Caught in a landslide<br />
No escape from reality<br />
Open your eyes<br />
Look up to the skies and see<br />
I’m just a poor boy, I need no sympathy<br />
Because I’m easy come, easy go<br />
A little high, little low<br />
Anyway the wind blows, doesn’t really matter to me, to me<br />
Mama, just killed a man<br />
Put a gun against his head<br />
Pulled my trigger, now he’s dead<br />
Mama, life had just begun<br />
But now I’ve gone and thrown it all away<br />
Mama, oh oh<br />
Didn’t mean to make you cry<br />
If I’m not back again this time tomorrow<br />
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters<br />
Too late, my time has come<br />
Sends shivers down my spine<br />
Body’s aching all the time<br />
Goodbye everybody I’ve got to go<br />
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth<br />
Mama, oh oh (anyway the wind blows)<br />
I don’t want to die<br />
Sometimes wish I’d never been born at all<br />
I see a little silhouetto of a man<br />
Scaramouch, Scaramouch will you do the Fandango<br />
Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me<br />
Gallileo, Gallileo, Gallileo, Gallileo, Gallileo, figaro, magnifico<br />
I’m just a poor boy and nobody loves me<br />
He’s just a poor boy from a poor family<br />
Spare him his life from this monstrosity<br />
Easy come easy go will you let me go<br />
Bismillah, no we will not let you go, let him go<br />
Bismillah, we will not let you go, let him go<br />
Bismillah, we will not let you go, let me go<br />
(Will not let you go) let me go (never, never let you go) let me go (never let me go)<br />
Oh oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no<br />
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go<br />
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me for me for me<br />
So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye<br />
So you think you can love me and leave me to die<br />
Oh baby can’t do this to me baby<br />
Just gotta get out just gotta get right outta here<br />
Oh oh oh yeah, oh oh yeah<br />
Nothing really matters<br />
Anyone can see<br />
Nothing really matters<br />
Nothing really matters to me<br />
Anyway the wind blows</p>
