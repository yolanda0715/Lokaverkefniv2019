	<p>“Hey Jude” is a song by the English rock band the Beatles that was released as a non-album single in August 1968. It was written by Paul McCartney and credited to the Lennon–McCartney partnership. The single was the Beatles’ first release on their Apple record label and one of the “First Four” singles by Apple’s roster of artists, marking the label’s public launch. “Hey Jude” was a number-one hit in many countries around the world and became the top-selling single of 1968 in the UK, the US, Australia and Canada.</p>

<p>Hey Jude, don’t make it bad<br />
Take a sad song and make it better<br />
Remember to let her into your heart<br />
Then you can start to make it better<br />
Hey Jude, don’t be afraid<br />
You were made to go out and get her<br />
The minute you let her under your skin<br />
Then you begin to make it better<br />
And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain<br />
Don’t carry the world upon your shoulders<br />
For well you know that it’s a fool who plays it cool<br />
By making his world a little colder<br />
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah<br />
Hey Jude, don’t let me down<br />
You have found her, now go and get her<br />
Remember to let her into your heart<br />
Then you can start to make it better<br />
So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin<br />
You’re waiting for someone to perform with<br />
And don’t you know that it’s just you, hey Jude, you’ll do<br />
The movement you need is on your shoulder<br />
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah yeah<br />
Hey Jude, don’t make it bad<br />
Take a sad song and make it better<br />
Remember to let her under your skin<br />
Then you’ll begin to make it<br />
Better better better better better better, oh<br />
Nah nah nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah, hey Jude (x16)</p>
