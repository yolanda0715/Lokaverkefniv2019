	<h1>This ain't a love song</h1>

	<p>01 May 2019 - bonjovi</p>
	<p>“This Ain’t a Love Song” is the lead single from Bon Jovi’s 1995 album These Days. It reached number 14 on the US Billboard Hot 100, number two on the Canadian RPM Top Singles chart, number six on the UK Singles Chart, and number one on the Finnish Singles Chart.</p>

<p>I should have seen it coming when the roses died<br />
should have seen the end of summer in your eyes<br />
I should have listened when you said goodnight<br />
You really meant goodbye<br />
And baby, ain’t it funny, how you never ever learn to fall?<br />
You’re really on your knees when you think you’re standing tall<br />
but only fools are ‘know-it-alls’ and I played that fool for you<br />
I cried and I cried, there were nights that I died for you, baby<br />
I tried and I tried to deny that your love drove me crazy, baby<br />
If the love that I got for you’s gone, if the river I cried ain’t that long<br />
Then I’m wrong, yeah I’m wrong, this ain’t a love song<br />
Baby, I thought you and me would stand the test of time<br />
Like we got away with the perfect crime<br />
But we were just a legend in my mind. I guess that I was blind<br />
Remember those nights dancing at The Masquerade<br />
The clowns wore smiles that wouldn’t fade<br />
You and I were the renegades, some things never change<br />
It made me so mad ‘cause I wanted it bad for us baby<br />
Now it’s so sad that whatever we had ain’t worth saving, oh<br />
If the love that I got for you’s gone, if the river I cried ain’t that long<br />
Then I’m wrong, yeah I’m wrong, this ain’t a love song<br />
If the pain that I’m feeling so strong is the reason that I’m holding on<br />
Then I’m wrong, yeah, I’m wrong, this ain’t a love song<br />
I cried and I cried, there were nights that I died for you, baby<br />
I tried and I tried to deny that your love drove me crazy, baby<br />
If the love that I got for you’s gone, if the river I cried ain’t that long<br />
Then I’m wrong, yeah, I’m wrong, this ain’t a love song<br />
Then I’m wrong, yeah, I’m wrong, this ain’t a love song<br />
Then I’m wrong, yeah, I’m wrong, this ain’t a love song</p>
