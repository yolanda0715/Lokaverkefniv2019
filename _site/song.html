	      <h2><a href="/2019/05/01/Here-comes-the-sun.html">Here comes the sun</a></h2>
	      <p><p>“Here Comes the Sun” is a song written by George Harrison that was first released on the Beatles’ 1969 album Abbey Road. Along with “Something” and “While My Guitar Gently Weeps”, it is one of Harrison’s best-known compositions from the Beatles era. The song was written at the country house of his friend Eric Clapton, where Harrison had chosen to play truant for the day, to avoid attending a meeting at the Beatles’ Apple Corps organisation. The lyrics reflect the composer’s relief at both the arrival of spring and the temporary respite he was experiencing from the band’s business affairs.</p>

Written, composed and produced by Jon Bon Jovi, Richie Sambora, and John Shanks, “Have a Nice Day” was the first single released from the band’s 2005 album of the same name. The overall message of the song can be taken several ways, but reflects an overall theme of both tolerance and defiance, and its title has a discordant effect from its message.</p>
