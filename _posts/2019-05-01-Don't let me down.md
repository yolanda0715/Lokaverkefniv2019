Oh, she does, yeah, she does  
And if somebody loved me like she do me  
Oh, she do me, yes, she does  
Don't let me down, don't let me down  
Don't let me down, don't let me down  
I'm in love for the first time  
Don't you know it's gonna last  
It's a love that lasts forever  
It's a love that had no past  
Don't let me down, don't let me down  
Don't let me down, don't let me down  
And from the first time that she really done me  
Oh, she done me, she done me good  
I guess nobody ever really done me  
Oh, she done me, she done me good  
Don't let me down, hey, don't let me down  
Heee! Don't let me down  
Don't let me down  
Don't let me down, don't let me let down  
Can you dig it? Don't let me down
