"Be My Baby" is a song written by Jeff Barry, Ellie Greenwich, and Phil Spector. It was recorded on July 5, 1963 at Gold Star Studios Hollywood by American girl group the Ronettes and released as a single in August 1963 and later placed on their 1964 debut LP Presenting the Fabulous Ronettes featuring Veronica. Ronnie Spector is the only Ronette to appear on the single; her future husband Phil produced their elaborately layered recording in what is now considered a quintessential example of his Wall of Sound production formula.

The night we met I knew I needed you so  
And if I had the chance I'd never let you go  
So won't you say you love me  
I'll make you so proud of me  
We'll make 'em turn their heads every place we go  
So won't you, please, be my, be my baby  
Be my little baby, my one and only baby  
Say you'll be my darlin', be my, be my baby  
Be my baby now, my one and only baby  
Wha oh oh oh  
I'll make you happy, baby, just wait and see  
For every kiss you give me I'll give you three  
Oh, since the day I saw you  
I have been waiting for you  
You know I will adore you 'til eternity  
So won't you, please, be my, be my baby  
Be my little baby, my one and only baby  
Say you'll be my darlin', be my, be my baby  
Be my baby now, my one and only baby  
Wha oh oh oh oh  
So come on and, please, be my, be my baby  
Be my little baby, my one and only baby  
Say you'll be my darlin', be my, be my baby  
Be my baby now, my one and only baby  
Wha oh oh oh  
Be my, be my baby, be my little baby  
My one and only baby, oh oh  
Be my, be my baby, oh  
My one and only baby, wha oh oh oh oh  
Be my, be my baby, oh  
My one and only baby, oh  
Be my, be my baby, oh  
Be my baby now
