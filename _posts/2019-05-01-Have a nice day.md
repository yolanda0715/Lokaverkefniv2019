"Have a Nice Day" is a song by American rock band Bon Jovi. Written, composed and produced by Jon Bon Jovi, Richie Sambora, and John Shanks, "Have a Nice Day" was the first single released from the band's 2005 album of the same name. The overall message of the song can be taken several ways, but reflects an overall theme of both tolerance and defiance, and its title has a discordant effect from its message.

Why, you wanna tell me how to live my life?  
Who, are you to tell me if it's black or white?  
Mama, can you hear me? try to understand  
Is innocence the difference between a boy and a man  
My daddy lived the lie, it's just the price that he paid  
Sacrificed his life, just slavin' away  
Oh, if there's one thing I hang onto  
That gets me through the night  
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to  
I'm gonna live my life  
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice  
Standing on the ledge, I show the wind how to fly  
When the world gets in my face  
I say, have a nice day  
Have a nice day  
Take a look around you; nothing's what it seems  
We're living in the broken home of hopes and dreams  
Let me be the first to shake a helping hand  
Anybody brave enough to take a stand  
I've knocked on every door, on every dead end street  
Looking for forgiveness  
What's left to believe?  
Oh, if there's one thing I hang onto  
That gets me through the night  
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to  
I'm gonna live my life  
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice  
Standing on the ledge, I show the wind how to fly  
When the world gets in my face  
I say, have a nice day  
Have a nice day  
Oh, if there's one thing I hang onto  
That gets me through the night  
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to  
I'm gonna live my life  
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice  
Standing on the ledge, I show the wind how to fly  
When the world gets in my face  
I say, have a nice day  
Have a nice day  
Have a nice day  
Have a nice day  
Have a nice day  
When the world keeps trying, to drag me down  
I've gotta raise my hands, gonna stand my ground  
Well I say, have a nice day  
Have a nice day  
Have a nice day
