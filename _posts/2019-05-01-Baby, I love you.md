Woa-oh, woa-oh oh oh  
Have I ever told you  
How good it feels to hold you  
It isn't easy to explian  
And though I'm really trying  
I think I may start crying  
My heart can't wait another day  
When you kiss me I've just got to say  
Come on baby  
(Baby I love you)  
Oh-ee baby  
Baby I love only you  
Woa-oh, woa-oh oh oh  
I can't live without you  
I love everything about you  
I can't help it if I feel this way  
Oh I'm so glad I found you  
I want my arms around you  
I love to hear you call my name  
Oh tell me that you feel the same  
Come on baby  
(Baby I love you)  
Oh-ee baby  
Baby I love only you  
Woa-oh, woa-oh oh oh
