"Born to Be Together" was released in February 1965 by Philles Records. It only reached number 52 on the Billboard 100.

The moment I saw you my heart knew it was forever  
You touched me and I swear I knew then and there that I'd never  
No I never  
Want somebody else to hold me  
Let another's arms enfold me  
Never never want nobody but you  
And then you kissed me  
And whispered tenderly  
Darling I love you, I love you, I love you  
And I knew we were born to be together  
We were born to be together  
Baby we were born to be together  
I never said a word but I know you heard me sighing  
You held me to your heart and I almost started crying, almost crying  
Baby I'm so glad you found me  
Put your loving arms around me  
Say you want me just the way I want you  
And then please kiss me and softly answer me  
Darling I love you, I love you, I love you  
I'll know we were born to be together  
We were born to be togeter  
Baby we were born to be together  
Baby we were born to be together (fade out)
