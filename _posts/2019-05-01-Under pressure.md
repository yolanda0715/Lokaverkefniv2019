"Under Pressure" is a 1981 song by the British rock band Queen and British singer David Bowie. It was included on Queen's 1982 album Hot Space. The song reached number one on the UK Singles Chart, becoming Queen's second number-one hit in their home country (after 1975's "Bohemian Rhapsody", which topped the chart for nine weeks) and Bowie's third (after 1980's "Ashes to Ashes" and the 1975 reissue of "Space Oddity").

Mmm num ba de  
Dum bum ba be  
Doo buh dum ba beh beh  
Pressure pushing down on me  
Pressing down on you, no man ask for  
Under pressure that burns a building down  
Splits a family in two  
Puts people on streets  
Um ba ba be  
Um ba ba be  
De day da  
Ee day da, that's okay  
It's the terror of knowing what the world is about  
Watching some good friends screaming  
"Let me out!"  
Pray tomorrow gets me higher  
Pressure on people, people on streets  
Day day de mm hm  
Da da da ba ba  
Okay  
Chipping around, kick my brains around the floor  
These are the days it never rains but it pours  
Ee do ba be  
Ee da ba ba ba  
Um bo bo  
Be lap  
People on streets  
Ee da de da de  
People on streets  
Ee da de da de da de da  
It's the terror of knowing what the world is about  
Watching some good friends screaming  
'Let me out'  
Pray tomorrow gets me higher, high  
Pressure on people, people on streets  
Turned away from it all like a blind man  
Sat on a fence but it don't work  
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn  
Why, why, why?  
Love, love, love, love, love  
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking  
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?  
Why can't we give love that one more chance?  
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love  
Give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?  
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word  
And love dares you to care for  
The people on the edge of the night  
And love (people on streets) dares you to change our way of  
Caring about ourselves  
This is our last dance  
This is our last dance  
This is ourselves under pressure  
Under pressure  
Pressure
