"The Show Must Go On" is a song by the British rock band Queen, featured as the twelfth and final track on their 1991 album Innuendo. It is credited to Queen, but written mainly by Brian May.[2] The song chronicles the effort of Freddie Mercury continuing to perform despite approaching the end of his life, although his diagnosis with HIV/AIDS had not yet been made public in spite of ongoing media speculation claiming that he was seriously ill.

Empty spaces, what are we living for?  
Abandoned places, I guess we know the score  
On and on, does anybody know what we are looking for?  
Another hero, another mindless crime  
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime  
Hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore?  
The show must go on  
The show must go on  
Yeah  
Inside my heart is breaking  
My make-up may be flaking  
But my smile still stays on  
Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance  
Another heartache, another failed romance  
On and on, does anybody know what we are living for?  
I guess I'm learning (I'm learning), I must be warmer now  
I'll soon be turning (turning, turning, turning), 'round the corner now  
Outside the dawn is breaking  
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free  
The show must go on  
The show must go on (yeah yeah)  
Ooh, inside my heart is breaking  
My make-up may be flaking  
But my smile still stays on  
Yeah  
My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies  
Fairy tales of yesterday will grow but never die  
I can fly my friends  
The show must go on, yeah  
The show must go on  
I'll face it with a grin  
I'm never giving in  
On with the show  
Ooh, I'll top the bill, I'll overkill  
I have to find the will to carry on  
(On with the show, on with the show)  
Show (show must go on, go on)
