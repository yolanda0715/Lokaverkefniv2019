I want him, and I need him,  
And someday someway woo I'll meet him  
He'll be kind of shy, and real good lookin' too  
And I'll be certain he's my guy by the things he'll like to do  
Like walking in the rain (like walking in the rain)  
And wishing on the stars (and wishing on the stars) up above  
And being so in love 
When he's near me, I'll kiss him,  
And when he leaves me woo I'll miss him  
Though sometimes we'll fight, I won't really care  
And I'll know it's gonna be alright 'cause we've got so much we share  
Like walking in the rain (like walking in the rain)  
And wishing on the stars (and wishing on the stars) up above  
And being so in love  
no no he'll never do  
(Bobby) no it isn't him too   
They would never no they'd never never ever ever love  
Walking in the rain (like walking in the rain)  
And wishing on the stars (and wishing on the stars) up above  
And being so in love  
Oh oh oh where can he be oh oh
