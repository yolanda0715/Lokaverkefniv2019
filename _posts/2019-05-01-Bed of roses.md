"Bed of Roses" is a song by American rock band Bon Jovi, first appearing in 1992 on the album Keep the Faith, then released as a single in late January 1993. Jon Bon Jovi wrote the song in a hotel room while suffering from a hangover and the lyrics reflect his feelings at the time. The song contains drawn out guitar riffs and soft piano playing, along with emotive and high vocals by Jon Bon Jovi.

Sitting here wasted and wounded  
At this old piano  
Trying hard to capture  
The moment this morning I don't know  
'Cause a bottle of vodka  
Is still lodged in my head  
And some blonde gave me nightmares  
I think that she's still in my bed  
As I dream about movies  
They won't make of me when I'm dead  
With an ironclad fist  
I wake up and french kiss the morning  
While some marching band keeps  
Its own beat in my head  
While we're talking  
About all of the things that I long to believe  
About love and the truth and what you mean to me  
And the truth is, baby you're all that I need  
I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses  
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails  
Oh, I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is  
And lay you down on a bed of roses  
Well I'm so far away  
That each step that I take is on my way home  
A king's ransom in dimes I'd given each night  
Just to see through this payphone  
Still I run out of time  
Or it's hard to get through  
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you  
I'll just close my eyes and whisper  
Baby blind love is true  
I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses  
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails  
Oh, I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is  
And lay you down on a bed of roses  
Well, this hotel bar's hangover whiskey's gone dry  
The barkeeper's wig's crooked  
And she's giving me the eye  
I might have said yeah  
But I laughed so hard I think I died, ooh yeah  
Now as you close your eyes  
Know I'll be thinking about you  
While my mistress she calls me  
To stand in her spotlight again  
Tonight I won't be alone  
But you know that don't mean I'm not lonely  
I've got nothing to prove  
For it's you that I'd die to defend  
I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses  
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails  
Oh, I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is  
And lay you down   
I wanna lay you down on a bed of roses  
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails  
I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is  
And lay you down  
On a bed of roses
