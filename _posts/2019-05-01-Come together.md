Here come old flat top  
He come groovin' up slowly  
He got joo joo eyeballs  
He one holy roller  
He got hair down to his knee  
Got to be a joker  
He just do what he please  
He wear no shoeshine  
He got toe jam football  
He got monkey finger  
He shoot Coca-Cola  
He say I know you, you know me  
One thing I can tell you is  
You got to be free  
Come together, right now  
Over me  
He bad production  
He got walrus gumboot  
He got Ono sideboard  
He one spinal cracker  
He got feet down below his knee  
Hold you in his armchair  
You can feel his disease  
Come together, right now  
Over me  
He roller coaster  
He got early warning  
He got muddy water  
He one Mojo filter  
He say one and one and one is three  
Got to be good looking  
'Cause he's so hard to see  
Come together right now  
Over me  
Come together, yeah (x9)
